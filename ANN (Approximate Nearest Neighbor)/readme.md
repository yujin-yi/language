|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| FAISS             | Highly efficient for large datasets, supports GPU acceleration                | Requires fine-tuning for optimal performance            |
| ScaNN             | Good trade-off between accuracy and speed, efficient for large-scale datasets | Relatively complex to configure compared to some others |
| pgvector          | Integrates with PostgreSQL, good for database applications                    | Limited to PostgreSQL environment, less mature          |
| Annoy             | Simple and lightweight, good for memory-mapped files                          | Not the fastest for large-scale queries                 |
| Glass             | Designed for high-dimensional data, supports various distance measures        | Newer and less tested in diverse scenarios              |
| HNSWlib           | Very fast, good balance of speed and accuracy                                 | Can consume more memory compared to some others         |
| BallTree (NMSLIB) | Versatile with various metric spaces, good for complex datasets               | Can be slower for very large datasets                   |
| Vald (NGT-ANNG)   | Scalable, designed for cloud-native environments                              | Requires more setup (e.g., Kubernetes cluster)          |
